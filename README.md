## Summary
In Hopping Home, you play as Braxton the Frog. Solve the five unique platforming puzzles to help Braxton get from froggie church back to their home! 
<br><br>
Braxton possesses the unique ability to switch between solid and ghost form at will, which helps them to complete some puzzles and navigate the world effectively. Navigate through ghostly logs while in ghost form and interact with torches in order to remove obstacles that solid Braxton otherwise couldn't move around. Completing the five different puzzles will all require a combination of Braxton's solid form and ghost form.

## Controls
The basic controls are:
<br>
* WASD for movement
* Mouse pan for camera controls
* Mouse left click for interaction
* Q for transforming between solid and ghost form
